## Overview

This Challenge isto build out Order-Summary and get it looking as close to the design as possible.



### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

-I learnt and was also able to use Images and background as background
```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background: url("../images/pattern-background-desktop.svg"),
    hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This helped me for background positioning of an image and a color. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
